# Prompt to Pick Up Next Time
"Let’s continue refining the Spellbook UI and build out the Journal Entry interface. We want to add mood tracking alongside journal notes, support spell usage logging, and explore richer animations or effects for spell casting. Also, let’s start integrating backend authentication and persistent storage so user data is saved across sessions. What should we tackle first, and how can we structure the components for scalable growth?"

# What Looks Done / Nearly Done
Spellbook UI with grid layout: You have a nice responsive grid displaying spell cards.

SpellCard abstraction: You’re using a separate SpellCard component (great modularization).

Casting interaction: Clicking a spell triggers handleCastSpell, sets the selected spell, and logs casting to console.

Mystical styling: You’ve applied fonts, gradients, shadows, and a shimmering text class (even if shimmer effect isn’t working yet).

Background effect: You use MagicalParticles for a magical atmosphere.

Casting info pop-up: Shows a styled popup with spell details when a spell is selected.

# What I Don’t See / Need to Confirm
User Authentication: No authentication logic shown yet.

Spell data model with mana cost: Your spell object doesn’t seem to have mana or manaCost visible here — are those properties included in your spell JSON and UI?

Spell usage analytics or logging beyond console? (Not shown)

Journal / Mood Tracking UI: No journal or mood components present.

Therapist/patient features: Not shown here.

Spell approval workflow: No signs yet.

Public spell library, bookmark/favorites: Not seen.

Multimedia uploads: Not seen.

Gamification (XP, badges, levels): Not seen.

Testing or deployment notes: N/A.

# Suggested Next Step
Can you please share the current status or code for the following?

Do you have any authentication (login/signup) implemented? If so, can you share code or describe?

Where are your spell data objects defined? Can you share a sample JSON or where they’re loaded?

Have you started on the journal/mood tracking components or data flow?

Do you have any therapist roles or dashboards?

Do you want me to help build shimmer animations or polish casting animations next?
